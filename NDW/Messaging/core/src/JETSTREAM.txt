JetStream Domain Concept

- In NATS JetStream, the Domain field in the jsMsgMetaData struct is used to identify the JetStream domain that the message belongs to.JetStream domains are a way to partition and isolate JetStream resources (like streams and consumers) within a single NATS server or cluster. This allows multiple independent JetStream deployments to coexist and be managed separately.The Domain field helps clients understand the context and origin of the message, especially in scenarios where multiple domains are used.Here's a brief overview:

- Isolation: Domains provide isolation between different JetStream configurations and data.

- Multi-tenancy: Domains can be used to implement multi-tenancy in a single NATS cluster, where each domain represents a separate tenant.

- Message routing: Domains can affect how messages are routed and stored within the JetStream system.
When working with JetStream, the Domain metadata can be useful for:

- Identifying the source domain of a message
- Implementing domain-specific logic or routing
- Ensuring messages are processed correctly within their designated domain

If you're not using multiple domains in your JetStream setup, this field might not be crucial for your specific use case. However, it's an important aspect of JetStream's architecture and can be useful in more complex deployments.
